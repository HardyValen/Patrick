### The NiSi Circular Filter Range
<ul>
  <li><strong>UV filters</strong> help to protect your image from the negative effect of ultraviolet rays (blue shades, haze effect and colour tone alteration.) Made with the highest quality neutral optical glass, they are also used to protect the front lens of your lens without losing detail.</li>
  <li><strong>Circular</strong> <strong>Polarisers</strong> (CPL) allow you to manage reflections and are great for shooting water where the reflection on the water would reduce visible detail. They also serve to further saturate and enrich colour in your shots.  Also available in the Landscape version with Titanium structure and accentuated polarisation. The “Circular” in Circular Polarisers refers to the nature of the polarisation, not the shape of the filter. </li>
  <li><strong>ND (Neutral Density)</strong> filters are used to extend shutter speeds or use wider apertures even in bright conditions. One of the most common uses is to decrease the depth of field with strong brightness, to make the water look like silk and to make people disappear from the crowded areas. 3, 6, 10 and 15 Stop screw-in ND filters available.</li>
  <li><strong>ND64 + CPL</strong> is a one of a kind filter designed by NiSi. IT is a 6 stop (1.8) filter with built in polarising layer allowing you to adjusted by simply rotating the filter. </li>
  <li><strong>Variable ND 1 – 5 &amp; 5 – 9 Stop</strong>: The perfect filter for the videographer. This filter boasts the Nano, IR and anti-glare treatments exclusive to NiSi. The Variable ND allows you to adjust the light absorption up to 9 stops with no chromatic defects or the dreaded “X” effect. <strong><a href="https://nisioptics.co.uk/variable-nisi-nd-vario-filters/">More info here</a></strong>.</li>
