## 100x100mm Neutral Density (ND) Filters
NiSi’s ND filters are crafted to reduce the amount of light entering the lens without affecting color balance. This enables longer exposure times and greater creative control in various lighting conditions. The filters are made from high-quality optical glass with nano-coating to minimise reflections and ensure accurate color reproduction.

## 100x150mm Graduated ND (GND) Filters
These filters are essential for balancing exposure in scenes with significant differences in brightness between the sky and the foreground. NiSi offers a variety of GND filters with different transition types (soft, hard, and reverse) to suit various shooting scenarios. Like the ND filters, they are constructed from premium optical glass with nano-coating for optimal performance.

Photographers over tools, we listen to our photographers, our products are born in your mind first. We ask what’s matter most, like the need of avoiding vignetting with ultra-wide angle, with the quality of our CPL polariser and 3 slot-in filters. NiSi’s 100mm Filter System is engineered to meet the demands of photographers seeking precision, ease of use, and high-quality results in their work.

The NiSi 100mm filter system is suitable for lenses with front thread up to 82mm.

You can mount the NiSi V7 holder on most lenses with lens threads of 49mm or higher by purchasing the required rings separately. Adaptor rings start at 49mm.

The NiSi V7 True Color NC Polariser Kit also includes the V7 lens cap for storing the lens while keeping the 82mm main ring and the polariser mounted on your lens. This facilitates transportation between locations.

  <p><strong>Note</strong>: The V7 holder is not directly compatible with the Tokina 11-20 f/2.8 with 82mm front thread or the Panasonic 70-200 f2.8.
