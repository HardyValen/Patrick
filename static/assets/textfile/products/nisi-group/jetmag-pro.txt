## How JetMag Pro magnetic filters work?

The NiSi JetMag Pro is a magnetic filter system; you don’t need to screw-on filters, but everything starts with a simple adapter ring.

NiSi JetMag Pro filters are not available in any size. Thanks to the magnetic adapter ring, you can buy the filter in the biggest size you need, and then adapt it. To avoid unnecessary expenses, we created two main sizes: 82 and 95mm.

### 1. Magnetic Ring Sizes
<p>The JetMag Pro magnetic adapter ring is threaded on one side (lens side) and magnetic on the other side (filter side).<sup> </sup><strong>On the magnetic side</strong>, there are two sizes: 82mm and 95mm. <strong>On the threaded side</strong>, you can find it in various sizes starting from 62mm.</p>

<p>JetMag Pro <strong>filters come in two main sizes</strong> matching the magnetic side of the rings: <strong>82 and 95mm</strong>, the choice depends on your bigger lens.</p>

<p>Firstly, choose the right size, <strong>if your lenses are up to 82mm</strong> front thread size (anything below 82mm still works of course), <strong>choose the 82mm</strong> magnetic adapter ring and any other smaller rings you need.</p>

<p>If you own some <strong>lenses above 82mm</strong> (86 and 95mm are becoming popular), <strong>you need the 95mm filters</strong>, so you can buy 95mm and/or 86mm adapters and any step-down rings you need.</p>

### 2. Filters
<p>Once you have the rings, you just need to add the filters you prefer!<br>You can choose between 82mm or 95mm filters, accordingly to your initial ring size choice.</p>

### 3. Front and Back Caps
<p>We also offer front and back caps, aluminium-made, to assure your filters are always protected.<br>The front caps are also useful for keeping your rings attached to the lens. One front cap for each lens + ring you want to keep always ready to attach a JetMag filter.<br>Back caps are useful to protect one or more filters in your bag, use a front cap on one side of the filter and one back cap on the other.</p>

### 4. Accessories
<p>We offer some useful accessories for your Kit, cleaning equipment and bag.<br>We also offer a holder to use 100mm wide GND filters for extra flexibility in light management. Thanks to this add-on, you can use 1 GND filter (100x150mm) with your NiSi JetMag Pro 82mm or 95mm; the holder is designed to avoid vignetting with one JetMag ND filter, one True Color CPL and one GND.</p>
