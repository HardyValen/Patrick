# Which NiSi System to choose?
It is not always easy to juggle the extensive product catalogue offered by NiSi. At the same time, it is essential to have a wide range of products to ensure good compatibility and flexibility.

By answering a series of simple questions we will guide you in choosing the perfect products for your goal.

## Does your lens have a front thread?
The first thing is to check your lenses to see if a front thread is present.

If all (or at least most of the ones you want to use with filters) have front threads, you should also note the size of the threads. Usually, you will find a size in mm followed by the “Ø” symbol on the front of the lens and/or barrel.
