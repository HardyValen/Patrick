## NiSi Cinema Neutral Density Filters
The **NiSi 6K Cinematic IR ND filters** are available in the densities of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 stops. Thanks to the incredible quality of the **IR and Nano treatments** of NiSi cinema filters, you will always get the **highest possible colour rendition.**

<p>The NiSi Cine filters are made of&nbsp;a <strong>NiSi exclusive</strong> <strong>lens grade optical glass</strong>&nbsp;of the highest quality so as not to lose even the smallest detail and to make them durable over time. The glass is treated with the&nbsp;<strong>best and most up to date techniques for multi-coating</strong>&nbsp;and with a special anti-scratch coating. “IR” indicates the presence of the coating to block the infrared light, and therefore a deliver a&nbsp;<strong>better chromatic correspondence</strong>.</p>

<p>Thanks to the&nbsp;<strong>absence of colour cast</strong>, you can finally say goodbye to expensive and time consuming colour correction in post-production.</p>

<p>Our Cinema filters are in the standard 4mm thickness and can be used with <strong>cinema matte boxes</strong> built to this standard. The industry standard and most common size is 4×5.65″, of which you’ll find the most comprehensive range available. We also provide an extensive range for 4×4″ and 6.6×6.6″ sizes.</p>

### Cine Sealing Technology
NiSi Cinema Filters series use Cine Sealed technology, edges of the filter are sealed with black resin to improve performance and durability. This technology reduces the influence of temperature fluctuations, keeps out condensation and protects the filter from unwanted flare and reflections. Compared to similar treatments, NiSi’s technology allows the edge of the filter to be sealed twice as efficiently, thanks to high-precision machinery and unique materials.

### Nano Coating®
All NiSi square filters benefit from the use of the exclusive Nano Coating treatment which makes the filter water-repellent and oleophobic for perfect sharpness. NiSi filters also use IR technology to block infrared light and therefore eliminate the risk of magenta colour cast. The special Nano Coating coating on both sides minimises unwanted reflections and gives the NiSi neutral density filters water-repellent and oleophobic properties.
