  ## NiSi Cinema Neutral Density Filters
  The NiSi Aureus Prime Full Frame Cinema Lens are a professional-grade lenses designed to meet the rigorous demands of modern cinematography. Offering full-frame coverage with a massive 46mm image circle, this lenses are built for large-format cinema cameras and delivers impeccable image quality across the entire frame. With a fast T1.4 maximum aperture, they excels in both expansive environmental shots and intimate, low-light setups—providing filmmakers with creative flexibility and cinematic depth in any shooting condition.

  The Aureus Prime lenses renders each frame with clarity, contrast, and character. The T1.4 aperture delivers extraordinary low-light performance, enabling shallow depth of field and beautiful bokeh even in wide-angle compositions. Combined with the lens’s 11-blade aperture design, this results in smooth, natural out-of-focus highlights and an organic visual aesthetic that enhances every frame.

  Engineered with an advanced optical design, the Aureus Prime lenses incorporates ultra-low dispersion elements that significantly reduce chromatic aberration, distortion, and color fringing—delivering lifelike color reproduction and edge-to-edge sharpness. Even at its maximum aperture of T1.4, the lenses maintains exceptional resolution and contrast, preserving fine details and maintaining consistent image quality from center to edge.

  The lenses features NiSi’s proprietary multi-layer coatings that reduce ghosting and flaring while enhancing micro-contrast and maintaining deep, rich blacks. These coatings help ensure superior performance when working in high-contrast or backlit scenarios, making them ideal for a wide range of lighting environments—from golden-hour exteriors to moody interior scenes.

  ### Virtually Zero Focus Breathing
  A standout feature of the Aureus Prime cinema lenses is its near-zero focus breathing—allowing cinematographers to execute smooth focus transitions without altering the frame’s composition. This precise focus behaviour is critical for storytelling, especially in dynamic scenes where emotional emphasis is guided through subtle shifts in focus.
  With a 300° focus rotation, the lens offers long, smooth focus pulls with finely calibrated resistance, enabling precise manual focus control for complex shots. This makes it ideal for both focus pullers on set and solo shooters demanding accuracy in high-resolution workflows.

  ### Creative Control with Rear Filter Mount and Dual-Scale Markings
  The Aureus Prime includes a built-in rear filter mount, enabling the use of Aureus PL ND Filters, diffusion, or creative filters without adding bulk to the front of the lens. This allows filmmakers to maintain a streamlined and balanced rig while expanding their creative toolkit.

  For ease of use in challenging lighting conditions, the lens features glow-in-the-dark markings for focus and aperture rings—allowing quick and accurate adjustments even in dim environments. The dual-scale focus markings are available in both feet and meters, and the user-swappable design lets operators customise the lens based on regional or personal preference.

  ### Perfectly Matched for Full Kit Integration
  All lenses share a consistent optical rendering style, colour reproduction, and micro-contrast characteristics, ensuring visual continuity across your entire project. This optical uniformity allows cinematographers to interchange lenses freely without introducing variations in colour tone or image character, streamlining the post-production process and maintaining a cohesive visual narrative.

  The AUREUS cinema lenses are compatible with all PL-mount cinema cameras and works flawlessly with PL adapters, including those featuring built-in drop-in filters. Whether shooting on ARRI, RED, Sony VENICE, or Blackmagic URSA systems, the lens integrates effortlessly into any production environment, providing filmmakers with professional-grade flexibility and performance.
