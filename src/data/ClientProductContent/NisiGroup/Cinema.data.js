  ## NiSi Cinema Neutral Density Filters
  The **NiSi 6K Cinematic IR ND filters** are available in the densities of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 stops. Thanks to the incredible quality of the **IR and Nano treatments** of NiSi cinema filters, you will always get the **highest possible colour rendition.**

  <p>The NiSi Cine filters are made of&nbsp;a <strong>NiSi exclusive</strong> <strong>lens grade optical glass</strong>&nbsp;of the highest quality so as not to lose even the smallest detail and to make them durable over time. The glass is treated with the&nbsp;<strong>best and most up to date techniques for multi-coating</strong>&nbsp;and with a special anti-scratch coating. “IR” indicates the presence of the coating to block the infrared light, and therefore a deliver a&nbsp;<strong>better chromatic correspondence</strong>.</p>

  <p>Thanks to the&nbsp;<strong>absence of colour cast</strong>, you can finally say goodbye to expensive and time consuming colour correction in post-production.</p>

  <p>Our Cinema filters are in the standard 4mm thickness and can be used with <strong>cinema matte boxes</strong> built to this standard. The industry standard and most common size is 4×5.65″, of which you’ll find the most comprehensive range available. We also provide an extensive range for 4×4″ and 6.6×6.6″ sizes.</p>
